# About the Project (collapsible)
with st.expander("📘 About the Project"):
    st.markdown("""
In rural industrial clusters, inconsistent power supply can lead to unexpected machinery breakdowns,
production losses, and safety hazards. This AI-powered tool predicts power supply fluctuations
using voltage trend analysis. It helps users make informed decisions—like delaying operations
or shutting down machines—before damage occurs.  
The project combines predictive modeling, data visualization, and real-time smart advisory
to support industries in low-resource environments.

# Mini Instructions & Checklist
st.markdown("""
### 📂 Instructions:
Please upload a `.csv` file containing power supply data.

**Required Columns:**
- `Timestamp` – Date and time of recording
- `Voltage` – Voltage reading (in Volts)

**Example:**
| Timestamp           | Voltage |
| ------------------- | ------- |
| 2025-06-01 12:00:00 | 229     |
| 2025-06-01 12:01:00 | 231     |

### ✅ Data Checklist:
- CSV has two columns: `Timestamp` and `Voltage`
- Voltage is in numeric format
- Timestamps are properly formatted
